# Design Patterns for C# (Gang of Four)

## Introduction

Contains the implementation of design patterns that are used to solve common problems in software design.
Takes away the burden of writing the underlying code for writing and executing the design patterns, and focus on the problem at hand,
i.e. using them for writing a well designed and implemented software solution.
The solution offered in the package has to be implemented in the correct way, but does not worry there are examples that shows how to do that.

## Usage

### Install

- Target frameworks: Net 6, Net 4.5
- Nuget package is available at: [GofPatterns](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GofPatterns/).

```bash
dotnet add package GofPatterns
```

### Execute

There are examples for each of the design patterns mentioned in [Implementations](#Implementations) section,
just click on the link to the design pattern and it will take you to the respective page of the design pattern that provides information and example.
